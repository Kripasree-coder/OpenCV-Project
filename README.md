**Brightness Control With Hand Detection using OpenCV in Python**

**Overview**
This project utilizes OpenCV and Mediapipe to detect hand gestures and dynamically adjust the screen brightness based on the distance between the thumb tip and index fingertip. The brightness level is mapped from a range of 0-100 based on the detected hand position.

**Features**

Real-time hand tracking using Mediapipe

Distance calculation between thumb and index fingertip

Dynamic brightness adjustment using Screen-Brightness-Control

Works on Windows and Linux systems

**Requirements**

The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

1. Mediapipe

Google's open-source framework for media processing.

pip install mediapipe

2. OpenCV

A popular computer vision library.

pip install opencv-python

3. Screen-Brightness-Control

A tool for adjusting the brightness of the monitor.

pip install screen-brightness-control

4. NumPy

A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

pip install numpy
